# Reduce the size of the repository by rewriting the branch history

You have a Git repository that is used by your team to collaborate on a project. The repo contains a single branch with a long history of changes.
You need to reduce the size of the repository by rewriting the branch history.

The git filter-branch and git filter-repo commands support rewriting history for a specific branch, which significantly reduces the repository size in this scenario.
